# Collaborate.md

## Goal
Establish how your team is going to work together. How you will manage your sources. How you will contribute to your sources. When you will meet, how you will communicate, who will scribe, how you will maintain your backlog, etc.

## The Team
### [Grant](https://github.com/wonggran)

### [Asher]()

### [Pablo]()

### [Benson](https://github.com/bensonchan)
I'm eager to learn about React and the latest trendy tools. Despite having two courses worth of web development, I didn't get around to learning any fancy stuff with javascript and AJAX. I have a great interest in UI design and user experience, having spent excessive time discussing (complaining) about it to my friends. My weaknesses are a general lack of experience in web development and a bad sense of humour.

### [Jay](https://github.com/JZ6)

## Communication
Communication will be done via Slack, Facebook Messenger, and Github Projects and Issues.

### Meetings
Meetings will generally occur after lecture/tutorial in either the same room or anything available. Additional times may be alotted.

#### Meeting 1 (Friday, October 5, 2018) [4PM - 5PM]:
* Took place during CSC302 tutorial in room BA2175.
* Team members present: Grant, Asher, Benson, Pablo, Jay.
* Notes: 
  * Discussed preliminary elements of the project, such as basic UI design, project infrastructure, and project   language/framework. 
  * We also decided to compile the strengths and learning goals of each team member on [Scope.md](Scope.md).

## Methodology
We will be using Agile via Kanban on Github's Projects feature. Due to the experimental nature of the project, the numerous unforeseen challenges should be best tackled with a flexible approach. Scrum assumes expertise in time budgeting, something we don't have and perhaps shouldn't enforce when the focus is on exploration and learning.

TODO: How to keep track of progress.

### GitHub
TODO: How we want to use github.

## Handout

You will create a plan for how your team will collaborate, review code, etc.
* Goal: Provide insight into your collaborative work as a team
* Make sure to describe the team’s competencies and constraints. Ex: Experience, strengths, skills, schedule conflicts and/or other relevant information about individual team members.
* Describe your meetings so far:
  * When, where (online, phone, physical location) of meetings
  * Who was there?
  * Rough meeting minutes/notes.
* Shared documents:
  * google doc? Github md? Links to google docs from markdowns?
  * Team Wiki?
* Given your experience meeting so far.. consider the logistics of your future meetings
  * When and where will you meet? 
* Agile/Scrum/Kanban?
  * There are excellent tools available to support your process, many offer free educational licenses for classroom use.
    * JIRA for scrum and/or kanban. (Our class can obtain a free JIRA classroom instance for you to use.)
    * Trello
    * Asana
  * If you decide to follow the scrum process:
    * What might you prime your backlog with?
      * Hint: figuring out how to set up TDD, CI..
    * How will you size your tasks? (story points? hours?)
    * Regular sprints? How many?
    * Who’s the scrummaster?
    * Who pretends to be the product owner?
    * How will you do regular standup meetings with your various conflicting schedules? Can online meetings help somehow?
* Create a strategy for how to divide work between individuals:
  * How will web client, endpoints, be divided across the team?
  * Which roles will individuals take on?
  * Repo man? (Inside joke. See http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087995/) 
  * TDD person?
  * CI person?
  * How and where will you store your shared documents?
* github/git How will you collaborate? When will individuals be allowed to push individual commits themselves? When is a PR necessary?
* Messaging: what will you use as a message board? Slack? HipChat? 
* How will you track your progress. Burndown chart? in story points?
