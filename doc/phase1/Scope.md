# Scope.md

## Goal
Triage the use cases to identify an area of focus for your team.

## Design Use Cases
### Learning Goals
Below are the skills and experience each member brings and their learning goals, from which focal use cases can be chosen from [the handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pIAb_yHoHQygp31I1gV69eHaMwOaWXZtDMfVHg3q5eQ/edit#heading=h.3a98l0b27xf8).

#### Jay
**Skills**  
Javascript, Python, C, Java  
**Learning Goals**  
I would like to improve upon my current full stack web development knowledge, as well as expose myself to new technology that are going to be relevant now or in the near future for my profession. I would also like to gain experience in working with a team of different developers possessing varying skill sets. We can accomplish this by building upon each otherâ€™s strengths and supplementing our own weaknesses.

## Handout
The individuals on your team probably have developed specific tastes over the last years as to what kind of code you like to build. The system as described is probably too big for a group to build (part time) in the style you would like to in the time you have. Hence, you will likely have to triage the use cases down to a subset in order to focus on the work that is the most valuable to you. We use the word valuable here in a very general way. (Perhaps because it's a technology you want to get to know more. Perhaps it's a technology you want to learn from scratch. Perhaps it's a technology that you think will improve your chances in the upcoming hunt for jobs)

Choose the subset in such a way that your team benefits from the project as much as possible. For instance, if you are a group that is keen on building a sophisticated user interface, you could pick a challenging part of the ticket assignment process and invest your effort in making an awesome drag and drop workflow. Naturally, the time spent on this may preclude building out UI for other use cases.  Do NOT implement exclusively CRUD web pages (these add little to the user experience nor teach you much) because there is not enough time to get creative. 
On the other hand, perhaps your team is not that interested in user interaction work but is very keen on learning how to build endpoints (REST or otherwise) efficiently and with minimal hand coding. Then, you could take on more use cases, implicitly leaving the UI very simple (for instance some of the UI could be triaged down to a invocations of a shell script. You probably would need to spend a lot of time studying one of the sophisticated REST frameworks, like django-rest.

In any case, in scope.md,  articulate  your team learning goals, the particular part of the application you have decided to focus your attention on, and which other parts this will force you to omit. (If the team learning goals represent less than consensus then perhaps you should discuss the issues with the instructor or your TA. If you are comfortable writing about how you came to consensus in the team scope.md that would be ideal.)
