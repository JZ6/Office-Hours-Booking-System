# Collaborate.md

## Handout

You will create a plan for how your team will collaborate, review code, etc.
* Goal: Provide insight into your collaborative work as a team
* Make sure to describe the team’s competencies and constraints. Ex: Experience, strengths, skills, schedule conflicts and/or other relevant information about individual team members.
* Describe your meetings so far:
  * When, where (online, phone, physical location) of meetings
  * Who was there?
  * Rough meeting minutes/notes.
* Shared documents:
  * google doc? Github md? Links to google docs from markdowns?
  * Team Wiki?
* Given your experience meeting so far.. consider the logistics of your future meetings
  * When and where will you meet? 
* Agile/Scrum/Kanban?
  * There are excellent tools available to support your process, many offer free educational licenses for classroom use.
    * JIRA for scrum and/or kanban. (Our class can obtain a free JIRA classroom instance for you to use.)
    * Trello
    * Asana
  * If you decide to follow the scrum process:
    * What might you prime your backlog with?
      * Hint: figuring out how to set up TDD, CI..
    * How will you size your tasks? (story points? hours?)
    * Regular sprints? How many?
    * Who’s the scrummaster?
    * Who pretends to be the product owner?
    * How will you do regular standup meetings with your various conflicting schedules? Can online meetings help somehow?
* Create a strategy for how to divide work between individuals:
  * How will web client, endpoints, be divided across the team?
  * Which roles will individuals take on?
  * Repo man? (Inside joke. See http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087995/) 
  * TDD person?
  * CI person?
  * How and where will you store your shared documents?
* github/git How will you collaborate? When will individuals be allowed to push individual commits themselves? When is a PR necessary?
* Messaging: what will you use as a message board? Slack? HipChat? 
* How will you track your progress. Burndown chart? in story points?
